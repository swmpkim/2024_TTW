# 2024 TTW R Workshop

## What you need to do before the workshop:

-   Get the programs on your laptop: recent versions of R (at least 4.2.0), RTools, and RStudio. Do these installations early, as administrative privileges may be required.

    1.  Download R for your operating system: <https://cran.r-project.org/>

    2.  RTools (only needed on Windows): <https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/>

    3.  Free version of RStudio desktop; note that R MUST be installed before RStudio: <https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/>

-   Install packages that we'll use. Copy and paste the following code into the Console pane of RStudio, and run it:

```         
install.packages(c('tidyverse', 'here', 'janitor', 'SWMPr', 'SWMPrExtension'))
```

-   Download 3-5 years of data from each of (at least) two SWMP water quality stations through the CDMO's [Advanced Query System Zip Download](https://cdmo.baruch.sc.edu/aqs/zips.cfm) and put it in a place you can find it.
