## Commonalities

No matter what you want to do, you need to get comfortable with a few basics first:

-   Getting data into R\
-   Making sure your data frame looks right\
-   Working with the data:
    -   Taking a subset\
    -   Summarizing\
    -   Re-shaping\
    -   Connecting one data frame to another

::: notes
We'll be focusing mostly on the first two today.

# Structure for today

## Topics

-   Background and vocabulary\
-   CODING - working with SWMP data
    -   learning about the code as we *do* things\
    -   Sticky notes - pink for "please come help me"; blue for "I successfully accomplished the task"
-   Moving forward

## Remember

## Tips

-   Be gentle with yourself\
-   Be persistent\
-   Help your neighbor\
-   Look for commas and parentheses/brackets first - either missing or extra\
-   Spelling and other punctuation next

::: notes
Punctuation - mainly parentheses or brackets. RStudio helps a lot with this - tells you when something is wrong (in the left margin), and enabling "rainbow parentheses" in the global options is MAGICAL.

Tools menu -- Global Options -- Code (from left pane) -- Display (a tab in main pane) -- Syntax (in the Display tab) -- bottom option: "Use rainbow parentheses"

# Understanding code and context

## File Types & getting meta about these slides

(so you can take notes in the R files that generated them, and render a complete document for yourself later)

-   .RProj - Project and how to open\
-   .R - the basic "R script"\
-   .Rmd - "RMarkdown"\
-   .qmd - "Quarto"\

. . .

Notes: demo .R and .qmd files; source/visual editor; and how to render.

## Vocabulary

-   function\
-   package
    -   CRAN\
    -   GitHub\
    -   others
-   project
-   working directory and file paths
    -   `getwd()`/`setwd()`\
    -   `here::here()`\

## Punctuation vocabulary

-   `'`   Single quote\
-   `"`   Double quote\
-   ```   Backticks\
-   `/`   Forward Slash\
-   `\`   Backslash\
-   `()`  Parentheses\
-   `[]`  Square brackets\
-   `{}`  Curly braces

## RStudio IDE

-   global settings
-   panes\
-   using the Environment pane to explore your workspace

## Key "operators" in code

-   assignment operator: `<-`\
-   pipe: `|>` or `%>%`\
-   comments: `#`

## Useful keyboard shortcuts

-   run a line of code: `Ctrl`/`Cmd` + `Enter`\
-   make the assignment operator (`<-`): `Alt` + `-`\
-   make a pipe (`|>`): `Ctrl`/`Cmd` + `Shift` + `M`
-   see more in RStudio's 'Tools' menu; 'Keyboard Shortcuts Help'  

## Subsetting operators  

-   `$`    ---   `df$column.name`  
-   `[rows, columns]`   ---   `df[1:6, 1:2]`  
-   `dplyr::select()`   ---   `select(df, column.name1, column.name2)`  
-   `dplyr::filter()`   ---   `filter(df, year >= 2015)`
